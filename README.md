# Random number guesser made in Java

Here's my attempt in making a random nummer guesser in Java, all within 55 lines of code.
I'm new to Java, so if you have any recommendations or tips, please share them with me.
This project was relatively quickly made and will likely see some updates in the future (f.ex. unlimited gameplay and choosing the range of the random number).

## Features
- Creating a random number between 0 and 100
- Checking wether the guessed number is higher, lower or equal to the random number
